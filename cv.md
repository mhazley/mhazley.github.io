### Education

**Queens University Belfast**  *[October 2004 - June 2009]*  
**MEng Electronic & Software Engineering**  *[First Class Honors]*

My degree explored such things as telecommunications, hardware/software co- design, application software development, embedded software development, analogue electronics, digital system design, computer networks, computer architecture, virtual reality and product design.

**Thesis**: *‘Investigation into Trust and Reputation Metrics for Open 802.11 Networks’*

This was a project that attempted to investigate trust and reputation within the ubiquitous WLAN by first understanding how malicious users can present themselves on the network. A packet capture tool was then developed in C to promiscuously capture power values from frames transmitted from APs and then attempted to develop a trust metric.
