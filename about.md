I am a highly motivated and creative Firmware Engineer with a proven record of strong technical development in a range of areas.

I like to code in C and C++, am pretty cosy scripting in Python and sometimes can be found hacking various web technologies until they 'work'.

I have experience working in a range of environments:

 - 8, 16 & 32 bit MCU's (SI Labs 8051/Freescale S12X/ARM Cortex M3)
 - IAR Embedded Workbench on Windows & GCC/GDB and Make on Linux
 - Particle's Photon Platform (Cortex M3 core)
 - Arduino / Raspberry Pi Prototyping Platforms
 - Git and SVN

I've worked on a number of different projects ranging from low power, network connected industrial sensing systems, to MISRA compliant automotive sensors, to low latency network middlewares, to beer brewing robots.

I am also somewhat proficient in electronic design and PCB design/manufacturing processes.

In my spare time, I like to make and listen to podcasts and brew beer.
