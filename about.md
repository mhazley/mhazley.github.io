I live in Columbia Missouri. I attended the University of Missouri here and earned a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.  C was the first programming language I ever learned, followed by Assembly and Perl. Weird, I know.  When I wasn't having fun in college I took interest in web development and haven't stopped since.

Right now my favorite tools are Go, Ruby, and Sinatra. In
general I like writting software and learning new tools. 

I currently work for [HashiCorp][1] and that's a lot of fun.
