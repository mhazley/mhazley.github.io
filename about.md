I am a confident Embedded Engineer specialising in IoT prototyping and development. 

I get excited when working with products at conception but also possess the experience and skill to take them from prototype to production, considering the full spectrum of requirements from platform choice through to HMI and UX.

I am equally comfortable deep in the code, motivating and directing a team or standing in front of a customer. This is backed up by 10 years of technical experience in small teams, with recent examples of leading, mentoring and product ownership.

I've worked on a number of different projects ranging from low power, network connected industrial sensing systems, to MISRA compliant automotive sensors, to low latency network middlewares, to connected breweries, to vacuuming robots, to next-level, IoT products.

I am also somewhat proficient in electronic design and PCB design/manufacturing processes.

In my spare time, I like to brew beer and listen to music.
