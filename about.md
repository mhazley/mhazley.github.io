I am a highly motivated and creative Firmware Engineer with a proven record of strong technical development in a range of areas. 

I like to code in C and C++ and am comfortable scripting in Python. 

I am comfortable working in a range of environments: 

 - 8 & 16 bit MCU's (SI Labs 8051/ and Freescale S12X especially)
 - GCC and Make in Linux or OS X
 - Comfortable with Git and SVN

I've worked on a number of different projects ranging from low power industrial sensing systems, to MISRA complient automotive sensors, to low latency network middlewares, to beer brewing robots. 

I am also somewhat proficient in electronic design and PCB manufacturing processes.

In my (limited) spare time, I like to present radio, make podcasts and brew beer.
